   chmod +x wifi_security_tester.py
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Run with root privileges:**
   ```bash
   sudo python3 wifi_security_tester.py
   ```

2. **Scan for networks:**
   ```bash
   sudo python3 wifi_security_tester.py --scan
   ```

### Attack Examples

#### Deauthentication Attack
```bash
# Target all clients on a network
sudo python3 wifi_security_tester.py --deauth -t AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF

# Target specific client
sudo python3 wifi_security_tester.py --deauth -t AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -c 11:22:33:44:55:66

# Limited packet count
sudo python3 wifi_security_tester.py --deauth -t AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF --count 100
```

#### Beacon Flooding
```bash
# Create 1000 fake access points
sudo python3 wifi_security_tester.py --beacon-flood --count 1000

# Continuous beacon flooding (Ctrl+C to stop)
sudo python3 wifi_security_tester.py --beacon-flood
```

#### Authentication Flooding
```bash
# Flood target AP with auth requests
sudo python3 wifi_security_tester.py --auth-flood -t AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF --count 5000
```

#### Probe Request Flooding
```bash
# Flood with probe requests for specific SSID
sudo python3 wifi_security_tester.py --probe-flood --ssid "TargetNetwork" --count 2000
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Specify interface and channel
sudo python3 wifi_security_tester.py --deauth -i wlan0 -t AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF --channel 6

# Scan with custom duration
sudo python3 wifi_security_tester.py --scan --duration 30

# Interactive mode (scan and select target)
sudo python3 wifi_security_tester.py --deauth
```

## üìñ Command Line Options

```
-h, --help            Show help message
-i, --interface       Wireless interface to use
-s, --scan           Scan for networks
-t, --target         Target BSSID
--ssid               Target SSID
-c, --client         Target client MAC (for deauth)
--channel            Channel to use
--count              Number of packets to send (0 = unlimited)
--duration           Scan duration in seconds

Attack Types:

--probe-flood        Probe request flooding attack
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Legal and Ethical Guidelines

### Legal Use Cases
- Testing your own home/office network
- Authorized penetration testing with written permission
- Educational purposes in controlled environments
- Security research with proper authorization

### Illegal Use Cases
- Testing networks without permission
- Disrupting public WiFi services
- Attacking networks in public spaces
- Any malicious use against others

### Best Practices
1. Always obtain written permission before testing
2. Document all testing activities
3. Use in isolated/controlled environments
4. Respect privacy and data protection laws
5. Report vulnerabilities responsibly

## üîç How It Works

### Deauthentication Attack
Sends deauthentication frames to disconnect clients from the target access point. This exploits the lack of authentication in management frames in older WiFi standards.

### Beacon Flooding
Creates numerous fake access points by sending beacon frames with random SSIDs and BSSIDs, making it difficult for users to identify legitimate networks.

### Authentication Flooding
Overwhelms the target access point with authentication requests from random MAC addresses, potentially causing denial of service.

### Probe Request Flooding
Sends numerous probe requests for the target SSID, which can be used to test how the network handles high volumes of probe requests.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No wireless interfaces found"**
   - Ensure your WiFi adapter is connected and recognized
   - Check with `iwconfig` command

2. **"Failed to set monitor mode"**
   - Try different wireless adapter
   - Ensure aircrack-ng is properly installed
   - Kill conflicting processes: `sudo airmon-ng check kill`

3. **"Permission denied"**
   - Run with sudo/root privileges
   - Check file permissions

4. **"Interface not found"**
   - List available interfaces: `iwconfig`
   - Use correct interface name

### Interface Restoration
If your interface gets stuck in monitor mode:
```bash
sudo airmon-ng stop wlan0mon
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```
