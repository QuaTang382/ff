## üõ°Ô∏è Legal and Ethical Guidelines

### Legal Use Cases
- Testing your own home/office network
- Authorized penetration testing with written permission
- Educational purposes in controlled environments
- Security research with proper authorization

### Illegal Use Cases
- Testing networks without permission
- Disrupting public WiFi services
- Attacking networks in public spaces
- Any malicious use against others

### Best Practices
1. Always obtain written permission before testing
2. Document all testing activities
3. Use in isolated/controlled environments
4. Respect privacy and data protection laws
5. Report vulnerabilities responsibly

## üîç How It Works

### Deauthentication Attack
Sends deauthentication frames to disconnect clients from the target access point. This exploits the lack of authentication in management frames in older WiFi standards.

### Beacon Flooding
Creates numerous fake access points by sending beacon frames with random SSIDs and BSSIDs, making it difficult for users to identify legitimate networks.

### Authentication Flooding
Overwhelms the target access point with authentication requests from random MAC addresses, potentially causing denial of service.

### Probe Request Flooding
Sends numerous probe requests for the target SSID, which can be used to test how the network handles high volumes of probe requests.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No wireless interfaces found"**
   - Ensure your WiFi adapter is connected and recognized
   - Check with `iwconfig` command

2. **"Failed to set monitor mode"**
   - Try different wireless adapter
   - Ensure aircrack-ng is properly installed
   - Kill conflicting processes: `sudo airmon-ng check kill`

3. **"Permission denied"**
   - Run with sudo/root privileges
   - Check file permissions

4. **"Interface not found"**
   - List available interfaces: `iwconfig`
   - Use correct interface name

### Interface Restoration
If your interface gets stuck in monitor mode:
```bash
sudo airmon-ng stop wlan0mon
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```
